Appropriate styling can make the difference between a bland, hard-to-use application and beautiful, intuitive application. Broadly speaking, styling a React application is no different from styling any other website. You write styles in CSS and target specific elements on the page using selectors like `h1` or `.navbar`. That said, there are many styling tools that provide additional features over vanilla CSS, such as compile-time variables and deep integration with React.

This section of the website provides an overview of the most popular styling tools in the React ecosystem and when you should consider using each of them.
